# Description
I built this project to show how Mongoose can be used to create, add, update, and delete data dynamically. It also was built to show how we can have schemas interact with each other, and finally shows the differences between mongo and sql.

## Usage
I hope to use this code in the future to create and develop new data bases. Its an easy way to add data to an existing data base, and to also update that along the way. 

## Installation
I started by building the file structure and installing all of my dependencies. I then built the server and routes. Finally the models and then built the get and post logic. 

## Credits
A lot of these concepts were taught in class. I also had to do outside research, and some tutoring to pull all the pieces together.
